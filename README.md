# EEE333Verilog
Verilog code for a class (Name witheld to prevent Academic Integrity issues) 

Just a collection of code for Verilog course. Uploaded so I could transfer files between work and home. No intent for this to be copied by anyone.

Please do not cheat / commit academic integrity violations. 

Additionally, nice to have some code for future reference and see progress from my first Verilog class/projects.
